  1) rust | terminal command: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  2) docker | terminal command: sudo apt install docker.io
  3) docker-compose | terminal command: sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.26.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
